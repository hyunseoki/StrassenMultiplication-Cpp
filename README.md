# Implementation of Strassen Algorithm w/ parallel programming for Matrix Multiplication
- I studied and implemented strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication
- I studied parallel parallel programming(very slightly) and implemented multi thread and OpenMP to boost the speed

# Performance
- Before the implementation of algorithm, I checked which data structure is the fastest static/dynamic array and vector You can check the code in Performance.cpp
- Matrix multipli

I will keep updating result
